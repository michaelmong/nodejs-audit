# nodejs-audit
Node.JS project for auditing the configuration

This [repo](https://github.com/michaelmong/nodejs-audit "nodejs-audit") has been created for sharing some relevant techniques to audit the MML configurations. Below are the list and detail of them that you can feel free to apply to your works.

  1. Https.js - HTTP and HTTPS (through express) - Required libraries to enable HTTP and HTTPS are fs, http, https, express and path. For HTTPS, self-signed certificate can be generated by OpenSSL.exe (downloadable from Internet) with the following command, "OpenSSL> req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt". In Audit project, HTTP and HTTPS has been used to provide webUI to users, instead of having another Frontend interface.
  2. Readfile.js - Reading text file line-by-line - MML configuration text file was used for INPUT of the audit process. Each line of MML configuration can be formatted as "COMMAND: parameter1=value1, paramter2=value2, ...., paramterN=valueN;". Everytime Node.JS read a line, splitting between command and all paramters with values must be done before moving to the next line. Eventually, output will be sent to excel module and written as an XLSX file.

  4. Working with excel by exceljs
